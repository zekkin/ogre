# zekk.works Ogre

It's been about 4 years since the group buy for this keyboard started and I figured it's time to put this design out there for people to play with at their leisure. The design has been obsolete for a long time but it can definitely be adapted to work as it was originally intended. I just don't care to do it.

Before going any further, please read this:

**Note: The information about "Kijin" in the Final Thoughts section in the document linked above has not been updated since I wrote the document. No keyboard named Kijin is currently planned as of July 4 2024 (if my overall inactivity in designs hasn't otherwise been an indicator).**

I'm releasing this with an MIT License. You are free to do what you want with this but I will not assist you in producing or troubleshooting the design.
